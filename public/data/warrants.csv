"California Highway Patrol","Kings","20-059A","03/12/2020 - 19:14","On February 23rd, 2020, I was on routine patrol as Unit B88-003, in full California Highway Patrol (CHP) tan uniform, driving a fully marked black and white CHP patrol vehicle, license plate number 1501466, which is equipped with an audible siren and at least one lighted steady red lamp visible from the front.  At approximately 2113 hours, I was traveling northbound on Interstate 5, south of Quebec Avenue, monitoring radio traffic, when I was dispatched by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) Fresno Communications Center (FCC) to a possible hit and run traffic collision that occurred on the Avenal Cutoff Road, near Nevada Avenue.  Dispatch advised the victim was standing by in a tan Dodge Caravan, on the Avenal Cutoff Road, south of Gale Avenue, and the subject vehicle, described as black Honda Accord with driver side damage, had fled northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  I acknowledged the radio traffic and began to respond to the victim’s location.  While responding, dispatch advised the reporting party, later identified as Alberto Ruiz Jr. (CDL: D7874178 DOB: 10/23/1986), had informed them the subject vehicle had passed them and was now traveling southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  I acknowledged the update and responded to the Avenal Cutoff Road and State Route 269, which is an area just south of the last known location of the subject vehicle.

At approximately 2122 hours, I was executing a right turn from northbound State Route 269 to northbound Avenal Cutoff Road, when I observed an older model black Honda Accord (Subject Vehicle) with damage to the left rear fender and bumper, traveling southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, approaching the fully marked and posted stop sign with State Route 269.  As I completed the right turn, I used the patrol vehicle’s driver spotlight to illuminate the driver side and interior of the subject vehicle.  I slowed to less than 5 MPH as I became adjacent to the subject vehicle and observed the driver (Subject) was a Hispanic male adult in his late 20’s or early 30’s with a thin build and was wearing a lighter colored button up shirt.  I executed a U-turn and positioned the patrol vehicle to the rear of the subject vehicle, a black 2003 Honda Accord bearing California license plate number 7MEY780.  I activated the patrol vehicle’s forward red lights and initiated an enforcement stop as the subject vehicle executed a left turn from southbound State Route 269 to southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  I advised dispatch I had located a vehicle matching the description provided by the reporting party and requested a registration and wants check using the California license plate number on the rear of the subject vehicle.  Dispatch advised the registration check returned with no wants to a 2003 Honda four door, registered to Javier Salgado Garcia or Lorena Herrera Espinosa at an address of 125 West Stanislaus Street, Avenal, CA 93204.

The driver of the subject vehicle momentarily yielded to the right shoulder of State Route 269, south of the Avenal Cutoff Road, before subsequently fleeing the enforcement stop, traveling southbound on State Route 269.  I activated the patrol vehicle’s audible siren, initiated a pursuit, and advised the Fresno Communications Center of the updated situation.  Despite my patrol vehicle’s forward red lights and audible siren activated, the driver of the subject vehicle continued to aggressively flee southbound on State Route 269 at speeds in excess of 100 MPH, while passing other uninvolved vehicles over solid yellow lines, a violation of section 2800.2(a) of the California Vehicle Code.  I continued to actively pursue the subject vehicle until we reached the intersection of State Route 269 and Hydril Road, where the subject vehicle drove over an elevated asphalt curb, through a drainage ditch, and continued westbound through the hills along the northwest edge of Avenal.  I advised dispatch I was unable to continue the pursuit due to the terrain and requested responding units to establish a perimeter while we waited for CHP Unit CE-H40, a Departmental police helicopter flown by Officer T. Blasingame, #17510, with flight observer Officer D. Henschel, #20808, to arrive overhead.  After arriving on scene, Officer Henschel located the subject vehicle due north of the Avenal High School Football Field.  CHP Unit B88-002 (Officer C. Ripley) and officers with the Avenal Police Department responded to the subject vehicle and discovered it had been abandoned.  After an exhaustive search of the surrounding areas, CE-H40 was unable to locate the driver of the subject vehicle and our perimeter was called off.  Officer Ripley requested a tow truck for the subject vehicle and later completed an inventory and CHP 180 to store the vehicle under section 22651(b) of the California Vehicle Code.  J and D Towing responded to the scene and would later tow and store the subject vehicle at the tow yard located at 1209 Milham Avenue, Kettleman City, California 93239.  I later contacted Officer Ripley who related to me the following: During the inventory of the subject vehicle, Officer Ripley discovered a blue and black cellular phone in the subject vehicle’s center console, that was later identified as an Axia Model: QS5509A Serial Number: 357485095454858.  Officer Ripley heard the phone ring through the subject vehicle’s speakers and realized that the cellular phone was connected to the subject vehicle through a Bluetooth adapter.  Officer Ripley retrieved the cellular phone which he kept in his possession until he handed it to me, and I booked it into evidence at the California Highway Patrol Coalinga Area Officer under evidence number: E20200014.

As Officer Ripley conducted the vehicle inventory, I responded to the reporting party of the possible hit and run, who was still standing by on the Avenal Cutoff Road, south of Gale Avenue.  Upon my arrival, I contacted the reporting party, who was identified by his California photo driver license as Alberto Ruiz Jr. (CDL: D7874178 DOB: 10/23/1986).  Alberto Ruiz Jr. related in essence the following: Alberto Ruiz Jr. was driving a silver 2010 Toyota Corolla bearing California license plate number 7BRY112 northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, south of Nevada Avenue, following his mother, later identified as Martha Delia Lopez (CDL: C0297658 DOB: 09/09/1961), who was driving a tan 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan bearing California license plate number 8ELA801.  As they traveled northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, Alberto Ruiz Jr. observed the subject vehicle, he described as a black Honda Accord, parked in the open dirt field, near the orchard, off the east shoulder of the Avenal Cutoff Road.  As Alberto Ruiz Jr. and Lopez drove past the subject vehicle, the driver suddenly accelerated from the field, entered the northbound lane of the Avenal Cutoff Road, and began to overtake the two vehicles.  The subject vehicle moved into the opposing lane of traffic and aggressively passed both the Dodge and Toyota before reentering the northbound lane directly in front of Lopez.  After reentering the northbound lane, the driver of the subject vehicle suddenly “slammed” on the brakes for no obvious reason in what Alberto Ruiz Jr. described as an attempt to “brake check” Lopez.  Lopez and Ruiz were able to adequately adjust their speed and they continued to follow the subject vehicle.  The driver of the subject vehicle continued to slow until all three vehicles were traveling at approximately 10 MPH.  As the vehicles approached the intersection with Nevada Avenue, Alberto Ruiz Jr. moved into the number two lane and attempted to pass the subject vehicle.  As Alberto Ruiz Jr. became adjacent to the subject vehicle, the driver of the subject vehicle suddenly steered to the right and began to force Alberto Ruiz Jr. off the road.  The subject vehicle continued to aggressively steer/veer into Alberto Ruiz Jr. until the two vehicles reached the tree line of an orchard, where Alberto Ruiz Jr. was forced to stop to avoid colliding with the subject vehicle or the trees.
As the two vehicles came to a stop, Lopez drove the Dodge off the road and came to a stop off the east shoulder, to the left rear of both vehicles.  The driver of the subject vehicle exited and began to approach Alberto Ruiz Jr. who placed the Toyota in reverse and began to back away from the confrontation.  Alberto Ruiz Jr. described the driver as a Hispanic male adult in his 20’s, near six feet tall, with a thin build, wearing blue jeans and an unknown colored shirt.  As Alberto Ruiz Jr. backed away, the driver reentered the subject vehicle, placed it in reverse, and accelerated quickly, intentionally ramming the right front of the Dodge with the left rear of the subject vehicle.  After striking the Dodge, the driver of the subject vehicle fled the scene northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, at a high rate of speed.  Alberto Ruiz Jr. contacted emergency dispatchers and notified them of the collision.  While on the phone with dispatchers, Alberto Ruiz Jr. observed the subject vehicle pass them in the opposite direction, traveling southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  Alberto Ruiz Jr. updated the dispatcher and awaited CHP arrival.

After obtaining Alberto Ruiz Jr.’s statement, I contacted his right front passenger, identified as Larissa Leann Ruiz (DOB: 04/26/2004); Lopez; and her right front passenger, identified as Luis Armando Lopez-Fierro (DOB: 08/06/1969) who all corroborated Ruiz Jr.’s statement with similar accounts.  After obtaining their statements, I formed the opinion the driver of the subject vehicle had attempted to assault Ruiz Jr. and Ruiz and had assaulted Lopez and Lopez-Fierro using the subject vehicle as a deadly weapon, a violation of section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code.  As the severity of the original crime had increased, I asked Officer Camara to later change the subject vehicle’s storage from section 22651(b) to section 22655.3 to ensure the vehicle was not released or accessed pending the issuance of a search warrant.","Crime of Violence","Assault"," ","Device Only"," ","Basic subscriber information from a service provider
